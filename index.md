## Charles Cui   崔元

PhD Student in Computer Science

Northwestern University

I am currently a first-year PhD student at Northwestern University, advised by [Jason Hartline](https://sites.northwestern.edu/hartline/) I received my Bachelor's degree at Oberlin College, where I was grateful to be advised by [Sam Taggart](http://samueltaggart.com/). 

### Research Interets 

My research interests lie at the intersection of theoretical computer science and mathematical economics. 

### In Preparation

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/yccui/charlescui.github.io/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
